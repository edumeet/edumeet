## Installation

### Prerequisites
 * Docker and docker-compose
 * Curl
 * If you want to access the service from the internet, you need a public IP address
 * 2 fqdns (one for the main service and one for the turn server) that point to the public IP address
 * Ports 80/tcp, 443/tcp need to be open on the public IP address
 * Ports 40000-40249/udp and 40000-40249/tcp are not strictly necessary, but are recommended for better connectivity

### Installation steps
1. Run the installation script
```bash
./run-first.sh
```
This will ask you for a main domain and a media domain. It will also ask you for an email address for the certificates, but you can leave it empty if you don't want to receive notifications about the certificates. The script will also ask you for the listen IP of the server as well as the external IP. If you don't have a separate external IP, you can use the same IP for both.

The script will then prepare the certificates and the services. You may inspect and change the values in the .env file as needed. The script will read the .env file and use the values from there if they are present, so you can also set the values in the .env file before running the script. You may delete the .env file to start from scratch.

2. Docker compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This will start all the services. And you are done. You can now access the service at the main domain you provided.

### Configuration
The configuration for the client is in the `client` folder. You may change it as needed, but no changes are necessary for the service to work.
An example for this configuration file can be found in the [edumeet-client](https://github.com/edumeet/edumeet-client?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-properties) repository. The configuration for the room-server is in the `room-server` folder. You may change it as needed, but no changes are necessary for the service to work.
An example for this configuration file can be found in the [edumeet-room-server](https://github.com/edumeet/edumeet-room-server?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-properties) repository.
