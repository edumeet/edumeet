# Changelog

## 3.5.0 or Next Version

### Added

* Add QoS set DSCP bits in IP header according to new option networkPriorities in app config
  Our media traffic should get now higher priority where QoS has been implemented.
  Routers will add higher priority or put media packets to low latency queue.
  If QoS implemented in L2 too, then switches also set the L2 CoS bits according DSCP.
  WIFI AP-s that implements QoS, also based on it could activate the multimedia extension MMS.
  Hopefully it will help and add little bit more priority lower latency in congested networks.
  At the time of this writing it is only implemented in Chrome.
